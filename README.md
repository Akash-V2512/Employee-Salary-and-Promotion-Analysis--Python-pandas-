Employee Salary and Promotion Analysis (Python)

About This Project

In this project, I performed an in depth analysis of employee salary distribution and promotion trends using Python.
The goal of this analysis was to understand how salary, experience, hiring trends, and promotions are connected, and how these insights can help HR teams make better workforce decisions.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

Why I Built This Project

Organizations often struggle to answer questions like:
Which department has the highest average salary?
Are promotions linked to experience?
How has hiring changed over the years?
Is there balanced gender representation across departments?

This project aims to answer these questions using real data analysis techniques.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

What I Did in This Project

Data Cleaning

Converted hire date into proper datetime format
Extracted hiring year for trend analysis
Created experience groups using binning
Checked for missing or inconsistent values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Department wise average salary analysis
Top 10 highest paid employees
Hiring trend over the years
Gender distribution by department
Promotion vs Experience group analysis
Promotion rate calculation

Key Insights

Employees with higher experience tend to have better promotion rates.
Certain departments have consistently higher salary averages.
Hiring patterns fluctuate across different years.
Gender distribution varies significantly across departments.
These insights can help HR teams improve workforce planning and promotion strategies.
 
Conclusion

This project helped me understand how employee experience, department, and salary structure influence promotion decisions within an organization.
Through exploratory data analysis, I was able to identify key patterns in hiring trends, salary distribution, and promotion rates. These insights can support HR teams in making more informed and data driven decisions.
Overall, this project strengthened my practical skills in Python, data analysis, and visualization while solving a real world HR analytics problem.
